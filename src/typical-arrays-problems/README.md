Towel Sort

Task

Your task is to implement the so-called 'towel sort' algorithm.

towelSort function should expect matrix of any shape for example:

[
 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
 [ 7, 8, 9 ],
]
Following matrix should be 'sorted' to:

 [1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9 ]
Write your code in `src/index.js. All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.

Prepare and test

Install Node.js
Fork this repository: https://github.com/Shastel/towel-sort/
Clone your newly created repo: https://github.com/<%your_github_username%>/towel-sort/
Go to folder towel-sort
To install all dependencies use npm install
Run npm test in the command line
You will see the number of passing and failing tests you 100% of passing tests is equal to 100p in score
Submit to rs app

Open rs app and login
Go to submit task page
Select your task (towel-sort)
Press the submit button and enjoy
Notes

We recommend you to use nodejs of version 12 or lower. If you using are any of the features which are not supported by v12, the score won't be submitted.
Each of your test case is limited to 30 sec.
